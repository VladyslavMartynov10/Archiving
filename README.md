This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# üìä Performance Comparison: Declarative vs. Legend-State (FSM)

In an experimental setup comparing performance between the standard **declarative React Native approach** (using `useState` and `useEffect`) and the **Legend-State finite state machine** approach:

## ‚úÖ Key Metrics on Old Architecture:

| Metric              | Declarative | Legend-State (FSM) | Difference (%) |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Average FPS         | 36.6        | 59.6               | **+62.84%**   |
| Average CPU Usage   | 92.7%       | 61.4%              | **‚àí33.76%**   |
| Average RAM Usage   | 143 MB      | 244.8 MB           | **+71.33%**   |

## ‚úÖ Key Metrics on New Architecture:

| Metric              | Declarative | Legend-State (FSM) | Difference (%) |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Average FPS         | 37.7        | 59.6               | **+58.09%**   |
| Average CPU Usage   | 71.1%       | 39.1%              | **‚àí45.01%**   |
| Average RAM Usage   | 172 MB      | 316.3 MB           | **+83.84%**   |

## üí° Summary:

- ‚úÖ **FPS Increased** by 58‚Äì63% with Legend-State.
- ‚úÖ **CPU Usage Dropped** significantly in both architectures.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **RAM usage increased**, which is expected due to the persistent state machine overhead.

These results suggest that **Legend-State provides substantial performance benefits** in terms of frame rate stability and reduced CPU consumption, at the cost of slightly higher memory usage. It is particularly beneficial for complex UI interactions or screens with multiple state transitions.
